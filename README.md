# chartshare

Chartshare is a python module for creating Standard Celeration Charts that are commonly used in precision teaching and behavior analysis.  I created this tool while in graduate school and I haven't had the time or need to maintain or enhance this project.  I do get the occasional request to use it, so I will make it available here.
